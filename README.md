<h1>  MAIN SCREEN </h1>
<br>
<p>The Main Screen will auto populate with Denver, CO. restaurants. The search bar above is where the user will input a destination; by city, state or country. The screen will begin rendering restaurant cards; each card will display a restaurant picture, name of restaurant, rating, address, small description and website link/button. Pressing the button will link to Yelp's actual page for said restaurant. Also in the top right corner there is a heart-button that will bring up a list of favorites. </p>
